# WALLET APP

## What this application does
 The wallet app is a digital wallet that
 allows you to add your credit and debit cards digitally to a wallet
 on your phone and perform secure transactions, along with view its details as required.

## Who will use this application
This application will be used by anyone who owns credit or debit cards
and wants to avoid carrying them or losing them to misplacement or theft,
whilst being able to access all of their cards functionality and more.
The app is extremely user-friendly and easy to use and thus will be used
by a large number of people. 

## Why did I choose this project
One of the things that made me fall in love with technology and programming is the ability 
simplify and digitize processes and make life easier for all humans.
The transition from a physical bulky wallet to an app with a few touches to perform the same 
operations using an e-wallet is a great example of this, and that's what motivated me to make this project.
